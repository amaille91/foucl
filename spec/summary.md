### [Trash](./trash.feature.md#epics)<a id="trash"></a>

The goal is to provide a trash system for **Notes** managed by Sharad. The trash should have a _server-configurable_ (as opposed to _user-configurable_) **TTL** and **MAX_SIZE**

As a user, I can be assured of

1. The [Trashing](./trash.feature.md#trashing) of deleted **Notes**<a id="trash-trashing"></a>
2. The [Access](./trash.feature.md#access) to __trashed__ **Notes**:<a id="trash-access"></a>
3. The [Deletion](./trash.feature.md#deletion) of __trashed__ **Notes**<a id="trash-deletion"></a>
4. The [Restoration](./trash.feature.md#restoration) of __trahed__ **Notes**<a id="trash-restoration"></a>

As an Sharad administrator, I can be assured of

5. The [trash time-safety](./trash.feature.md#timeSafety)<a id="trash-timeSafety"></a>
6. The [trash space-safety](./trash.feature.md#spaceSafety)<a id="trash-spaceSafety"></a>
7. The [Server Configurable](./trash.feature.md#serverConfigurable) aspects of the trash<a id="trash-serverConfigurable"></a>
